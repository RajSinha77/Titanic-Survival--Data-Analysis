# Titanic-Survival--Data-Analysis



Features: The titanic dataset has roughly the following types of features:

Categorical/Nominal: Variables that can be divided into multiple categories but having no order or priority.
Eg. Embarked (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
Binary: A subtype of categorical features, where the variable has only two categories.
Eg: Sex (Male/Female)
Ordinal: They are similar to categorical features but they have an order(i.e can be sorted).
Eg. Pclass (1, 2, 3)
Continuous: They can take up any value between the minimum and maximum values in a column.
Eg. Age, Fare
Count: They represent the count of a variable.
Eg. SibSp, Parch
Useless: They donâ€™t contribute to the final outcome of an ML model. Here, PassengerId, Name, Cabin and Ticket might fall into this category.
